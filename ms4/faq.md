# Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor "Mindstorms 4" 51515 FAQ

This FAQ has been written from the perspective of using a _Windows PC_ as host, not e.g. a tablet.


## How to switch off the brick?
I opened the box, and one of the first things I did was to power on the brick.
However, I could not figure out how to switch it off.

You have the first download the "IDE" (next question) on your PC (probably MAC also works, but phone doesn't) and then
upgrade the Hub OS. Only then I was able to switch the hub off.

How? Keep the big button pressed, it gives three beeps, and then you can release.
In some cases (Python program running instead of a Word Block) I do not hear the three beeps.


## Where is the Lego software?
The booklet tells you to visit [https://www.lego.com/devicecheck](https://www.lego.com/devicecheck).
I skipped that, because I have a brand new PC and a brand new Android device.
But then I wondered where should I _download_ the Mindstorms software?

Well, go to [devicecheck](https://www.lego.com/devicecheck), select mindstorms, 
and click on of the "stores" to download the app.

You might like to try the [Spike prime software](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/spike-prime/software).
It seems identical, and it has support for the force sensor, whcih is missing in the Mindstorms app. Did not try.

## How to make a shortcut to the app on my Windows Desktop?
I don't like "apps" from the Windows store. They are special in all kind of ways. 
For example how do you create a shortcut on your desktop?

Go to Start > Run (e.g. Windows-R) and enter `shell:AppsFolder`.
This pops up a folder with app, and you can drag a shortcut to e.g. your Desktop.

Found [here](https://winaero.com/desktop-shortcut-store-app-windows-10/).


## What are the technical specs of Mindstorms 4?
Lego has leaflets on [Spike prime](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/spike-prime/technical-specifications), which
is largely the same.

  **cpu:** 100MHz M4, 320 kB RAM, 1M FLASH; 32MB RAM extern  
  **battery**:  2100 mAh @ 7.3 V  >500 cycles
- **color sensor**: 100 Hz sample rate,  color sensing (RGB/HSV), reflectivity sensing, ambient sensing, white led emission

- **motor**: torque 0..18 Ncm, speed 0..185 RPM, current 110..800 mA;  
  **rotation sensor**: 360 ticks per revolution, 3 degrees accuracy, 100 Hz sampling


## Which projects can I build?
Of course, there are the five robots that come with the box.
Building instructions are digital only, you can find them in the app via Help > Settings > Building instructions.
Or you can click the robot in the home screen, and go from there in smaller steps.
Do note that the robots come with add-ons, which are really great, 
for example [charly drum master](https://youtu.be/EAHvnpIGu1U)
or [tricky chain reaction](https://youtu.be/szFxBSRUh7c?t=167)

If you like more, or simpler builds, you could have a look at [Spike prime instructions](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/spike-prime/building-instructions)


## Where are my recent projects?
When you start the Lego Mindstorms Robot inventor app, you get a screen with pictures (links) to the 5 robots.
At first this is nice, but after a while you want to continue with your own projects.

You have to click PROJECTS at the bottom of the app's home screen. 
Unfortunately, thw list of projects starts with the standard lego ones, and not with e.g. the most recent ones. 
You have to scroll all the way down.

The Lego app is very limited in using _keys_. The DownArrow doesn't work. Fortunately PageDown does work.
So does the scroll wheel. The scroll bar itself is too thin to easily grab with the mouse. Grr.


## How should I name my projects?
Most projects end up with a name like `Project 17`, because the Lego app does not ask for a name. 
By default it just numbers them, using the lowest free number.

You have to explicitly remember to press Save As (preferably right after you create a new project). Grr.


## How do I start a new project?
Want to start a new project? Press CODE at the bottom of the home screen. You get an empty new Word Block
program. Rather have a Python program? In the Word Block editor (top) create a new tab. 
Or, in the home screen click File > New Project. 

Now you are _asked_ for the type of project (Word Block or Python).

After creating the project I suggest to immediately rename with File > Save As.


## Where are my projects saved?
The lego app made a directory `C:\Users\maarten\Documents\LEGO MINDSTORMS` for my (Maarten's) projects. 
If you Save As `xxx`, the file ends up there, as `xxx 1.lms`.

The extension probably refers to Lego MindStorms. The "space-one" suffix is automatically appended.
The next time you Save As a project and _type_ `xxx` it gets the name `xxx 2.lms` (note the `2`).
Non standard windows behavior. Grr.

You can however Save As and _select_ the existing `xxx 1.lms`. 
That pops up an "are you sure you want to overwrite" dialogue. 


## How to save my project?
There is no Save button. 

It seems the project is saved constantly when you interact with it (clicking the tab is enough).
I see the time stamp change in the file explorer. 

The only condition is that the project is non-empty, or that you did a Save As.
So, an empty project that is not renamed does not yet get saved.


## Can I "remote control" my robot?
A bit hidden feature in the Word Block IDE are the two icons on the right hand side.

The top one (Remote Control) allows you to create a "Remote Control" pane in the IDE, with _widgets_.
The widgets on the PC pane communicate via Bluetooth to the Hub. 
On the hub they trigger events that can be used in your program. 

Great feature! Missing are widgets that _output_ content; most _input_ events in you program.
For example a virtual LED would be nice, or a string box, or a string list (dare I say "console").

There is one serious drawback: the program [needs](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/help/products/themes-sets/lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor/coding-with-the-lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor-app-408100000020946#:~:text=Because%20Streaming,running) to execute in streaming mode (ie live connection to the PC).

The remote control is not present in Python - probably because it has no streaming mode.

## Can I remote control my robot with a game controller?
At this moment in beta, there is the option to add support for game controllers (Sony, XBox).

Click the Block Extension button and then either enable the DualShock or XBox One controller.
New blocks will pop-up in your palette (left). 

I assume the controllers send their "button presses" via bluetooth to the PC, the stream to the hub.
I don't have one so can not test.

There is one serious drawback: the program [needs](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/help/products/themes-sets/lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor/coding-with-the-lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor-app-408100000020946#:~:text=Because%20Streaming,running) to execute in streaming mode (ie live connection to the PC).

The remote control is not present in Python - probably because it has no streaming mode.

## How can I debug my Word Block program?
A bit hidden feature in the Word Block IDE are the two icons on the right hand side.

The bottom one (Show/Hide Monitor) allows you to show (hide) a pane with a live view of the variables. 

Great feature! Not present in Python, but Python has a better feature: the console!
A downside is that the monitor updates periodically (timed), so you do not see all changes.

The monitor feature does work in "download mode", you  do not have to use "streaming mode". I did expect that...

![Monitor](images/monitor.png)


## How can I debug my Python program?
Python lacks the monitor feature. Bummer!
But it does have something better: a console.

You can just `print()` in the hub code, and the print result is send to the PC console.

![Console](images/console.png)

I have not yet found a way to `input()` - that is a pity.


## How to send my project to the Hub?
There are actually three ways to do that.

- The most straighforward way is to press the Play button.
  Your program is compiled, uploaded and run. if a program was running on the hub, it is stopped.
  Note that the Hub has 20 slots(0..19), the app calls them "storage positions". 
  By default your program goes to slot 0, but if you click the slot select button, you can specify another one.
  
  If you open the Hub connection on the PC, and then select tab Programs, 
  you see the slots with the names of the project they store. Plus the option to delete or reorder slots. 

- Another way it to only download, not _run_: press the Download button in the slot selection pane.

- A special way to run is _streaming_ mode. 
  It does not save the project in a slot. So code is lost after stopping the program.
  Python does not support streaming.

![Play](images/play.png)


## What is streaming?
I'm not entirely sure of all the details of [streaming mode](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/help/products/themes-sets/lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor/coding-with-the-lego-mindstorms-robot-inventor-app-408100000020946).

- The program youâ€™re creating is not stored in a slot on the hub as is with download mode. 
- Instead, the PC maintains a connection with the hub, and the instructions will stream to the hub as they are executed.
- You can make "live" changes in your program (see figure).
- Streaming is faster.
- Remote control (pane in Mindstorms app, or Game controller) requires streaming mode.
- Somehow, showing the monitor does not require streaming mode.
- Also, sound via PC does not require streaming mode.
- I don't know yet if e.g. the "weather" extension needs streaming.

![Streaming](images/streaming.png)


## Isn't streaming mode slow?
In streaming mode, the code is streamed from the PC to the hub, while the program is executed.
This sounds a bit like an interpreter, and thus it sounds slow.

It isn't. In fact, it is the other way around: streaming is nearly 1000x faster.
Disclaimer: my test program does not execute a balanced set of blocks, and that is an understatement.

I guess the reason for this is that in streaming mode, all the code is run on the PC, and only _actuator commands_ and _sensor reads_ are streamed to the hub.

![Speed comparison](images/speed.png)


## Is there help (API documentation) for Word Blocks?
Yes, sort off. If you press Settings in the home screen, or Help > Setting, you can pick _Help and Support_ and then
_Word block description_. This has a two or three lines of help per block.

It has a very bad document structure (hard to see sections), does not support copy and paste, and worst of all,
can not be opened while programming. Grr.

![Word block help](images/wordblockhelp.png)


## Is there help (API documentation) for Python?
The help for Python is found on the right had side in the Python editor.

It is better than the help for Word Blocks. Document structure is better but not good. 
Does support copy and paste (although not for every piece of text).
Can be open during programming (pfeew). 

![Python help](images/pythonhelp.png)


## How to stop my program?
Good question: if you program doesn't stop, the hub will not power down, so stopping is important.

In Word block, there is an explicit stop block.

![Stopping in Word block](images/wordblockstop.png)

In Python, I haven't found a good one yet. I did find `os.exit(0)`.
It does stop the program, but with a sort-of error.
You can see this in the console (red message), but also the center LED on the hub flashes red 3 times.

![Stopping in Python](images/pythonstop.png)


## How to update the hub firmware?
I see people talk about hub firmware updates, but the Mindstorms app does not have a feature for that - at least I couldn't find it. Maybe the Spike prime app allows explicit firmware updates (downgrades, alternatives...).

However, when lego releases a new version, you will get a message in the app. If you accept it the hub will be updated.
This updates the hubâ€™s OS, not the user data (saved projects).


## What are the hotkeys?
I think lego did a bad job here. Many functions are not operatable by key.
Probably lego aims at touch screens.  

Note #=shift, ^=ctrl, @=alt

Word blocks is horrible
  - ^Z for undo is working, but ^Y for redo isn't (it is available in bottom menu or right click menu)
  - @F4 stops aplication.
  - @F or @H (for file or help menu) is _not_ working.
  - Cut and paste (^C, ^V) is _not_ working. You can right-click and Duplicate, but this duplicates the whole stack.
  - I found not hotkey for Run or Download
  - Cursor keys (panning) do nothing

Python is better. But not due to Lego, but because they took a standard control for the editor.
It behaves much like [Microsoft Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) 
  - ^C, ^V, ^X for copy, paste, cut
  - ^Z, ^Y for undo, redo
  - cursor movement with arrow or page keys, optionally in combination with ^ 
  - Select by pressing # while moving cursor
  - ^F, ^H for find and replace (grr the hub bar overlaps with the find bar)
  - **^#P issues a play**
  - ^#D issues a download
  - **there is no way to clear the console other than to restart the whole mindstorms app - grr**
  - **you can only walk up (arrow-up, page-up) in the console, not down, and the scroll bar sucks - grr**
  - fancy line commenting: ^K^C add line comment, ^K^U delete line comment, ^/ toggle line comment
  - #@A to toggle block comment
  - very fancy multi cursor (bit over the top) with @click, or ^#@ with cursor movement
  - **there is no rich languages editing, ^SPC appears to work but it doesn't know the object, it just shows all occuring strings**
  

(end)
